## Usage
This plugin does nothing significant on its own, its 1 part of a 3 part system, a backend and a frontend is also required, the installation process its available under the [Wiki](https://github.com/Rachnus/GIMP-Tracker/wiki/) section of this repository 

Once you have an endpoint to connect to with the plugin, head over to the GIMP Tracker settings

* ~~Runelite plugin URL setting: `https://gimptracker-backend.herokuapp.com/`~~

**Heroku free tier is no longer available, so not hosting this anymore**

## Settings
Heres a couple settings

* **Password**: should match the password set by the backend in the `config.js` file
* **Send Data**: if enabled, it will update your character on the website every tick
* **Connect on login**: if enabled, it will automatically connect to the backend upon login
* **Send equipment/skill/inventory/health/prayer/run data**: if enabled, it will send updates about set data

## Status
